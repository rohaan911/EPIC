									<h1>Creative Problem<br />
									Solving</h1>
									<p>What is creativity?<br />
									How is it different from innovation and invention?<br />
									And what even was the point of that weird rabbit in Donnie Darko?</p>

								<p>One day a farmer’s donkey fell down into a Well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally, he decided the donkey was old, and the Well, needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn’t worth it to retrieve the donkey. He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. <br /> 
								At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone’s amazement he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well. He was astonished at what he saw. With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey did something amazing. He shook it off and took a step up. As the farmer’s neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and happily trotted off</p>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>According to a scientific study done in 2012 Neural Correlates of Lyrical Improvisation: An fMRI Study of Freestyle Rap artists revealed the “Science” behind creativity and it is not as easy as left brain and right brain. So, in case if you are under the myth of not being good with painting or music or dance and that directly affects your creative being, rejoice – because that is not true. Creativity requires chaotic synchronicity from all parts of brain. That’s enough of science. Let’s focus on how “YOU” - can be more creative with solving the big problems of modern world.</p>

									Legend has it that Paul McCartney composed the song "Yesterday" in a dream.

								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>From the famous “Applied Imagination" by the ad-man Alex Osborn to Dr.de Bono’s Six Thinking Hats, there are umpteen tools, theories, articles on what creativity is all about. One derived commonality between all the science and art of creativity is that it is about opening up your mind to unlimited possibilities. And this means letting your mind wander away from the core subject itself, let it intentionally explore and then bringing in back in CONTEXT of your subject again. This is an artful process in itself.
								Much like Einstein’s combinatory play. He took violin breaks whenever he got stuck on a problem. These distractions allow you to engage in thinking on a subconscious level.</p>
